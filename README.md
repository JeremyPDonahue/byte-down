This is the first thing I ever coded. Kept here for the sake of nostalga.

# byte-down
A game centered around the value of a byte

Objective: Calculate the numeric value of the byte presented to you.

Just as the decimal system has a 1's place, a 10's place and so on, the binary system has a similar configuration. However, in binary each place is double the amount of the previous one. It starts from the right hand side and doubles with each shift to the right as shown in the hint section.

This game is centered around the notion of a byte. A byte can store values anywhere from 0 to 255 using a combination of 1's and 0's. This is done by using the values associated with each position and adding them together if that position is "on" or in other words contains a 1.
